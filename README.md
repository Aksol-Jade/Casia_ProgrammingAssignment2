# Linear Regression with Ridge Regularization

---

## Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of linear regression using Ridge regularization. The goal is to model and evaluate the relationship between audio or track-related features and a target outcome (e.g., stream count), addressing multicollinearity and overfitting through regularization.

---

## Objectives

* Prepare and explore a music-related dataset.
* Apply Ridge regression to predict a target variable.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
* Visualize residuals and key regression diagnostics.

---

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

* Import necessary libraries and dependencies.
* Explore feature distributions and check for missing values.
* Perform any required preprocessing or normalization.

### 2. Dataset Splitting

* Separate data into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split`.

### 3. Ridge Regression Implementation

* Use `Ridge` from `sklearn.linear_model` to fit a regularized linear model.
* Experiment with hyperparameter tuning via the `alpha` parameter.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R-squared (RÂ²)
* Residual plot visualization

## Tools and Technologies

* **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Modeling Technique**: Ridge Regression
* **Validation Approach**: Train-test split

---

## Insights

* Regularization helps mitigate overfitting in high-dimensional datasets or datasets with multicollinearity.
* Ridge regression retains all features but penalizes large coefficients, leading to more stable and interpretable models.
* Visualization of residuals allows for diagnosing potential model misspecifications.

---

## Next Steps

* Consider comparing with Lasso or ElasticNet to evaluate coefficient sparsity.
* Explore cross-validation to optimize the regularization parameter.
* Expand feature engineering for deeper model insights.
